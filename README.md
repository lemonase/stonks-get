## Stonke Search

The goal here is to get straight DD and watchlists from various sources on the web
while filtering through memes and shitposts:

### Reddit Sources

```python
sub_reddits = [
    "pennystocks",
    "RobinHoodPennyStocks",
    "Daytrading",
    "StockMarket",
    "stocks",
    "investing",
    "wallstreetbets",
]
```

### Other Sources

- Finviz
- SeekingAlpha
- YahooFinance
- OpenInsider

Output will be text or json, but in the future, we will use a more structured approach by using a database.
